When measuring execution time, system processes and RAM capacity can cause interference, and the 
results will be incorrect. The timeit.timeit() function runs the code over and over again and 
returns the total execution time, which averages random delays but does not report variation across 
runs. The timeit.repeat() function runs the timing test repeatedly, reporting varying results for 
each run. This will detect inconsistencies and interference. 

When calling timeit.timeit(), the optimal statistic is the average time per run since it shows 
typical performance. With timeit.repeat(), the minimum time is most informative since it shows 
the best achievable performance without interference. The average and maximum times may also be 
used to understand variations in performance. 

Use timeit.timeit() for a rapid estimate and timeit.repeat() to analyze performance fluctuations.
