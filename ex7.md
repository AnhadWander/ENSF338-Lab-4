1. Time Complexity Analysis of reverse() Implementation
 The given implementation of reverse() has a time complexity of O(n²) due to its inefficient method of accessing elements. The outer loop iterates O(n) times, decrementing from n-1 to 0.
 The inner operation get_element_at_pos(i) runs O(n) in the worst case, since accessing an element at position i in a singly linked list requires traversing from the head.
Since get_element_at_pos(i) is called inside the loop, the total complexity becomes: 𝑂(𝑛)×𝑂(𝑛)=𝑂(𝑛2)
This makes the function inefficient for larger lists as it repeatedly traverses the list for each element.


2. Optimized reverse() Implementation
The optimized implementation eliminates the need to call get_element_at_pos(i), reducing the complexity to O(n).

Optimized 
```
def reverse(self):
    prev = None
    current = self.head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next  
        current.next = prev     
        prev = current            
        current = next_node      
    self.head = prev  # Update head to the new first node
```

The function only traverses the list once, flipping pointers in-place.
Each node’s next pointer is modified in O(1) time, so the total complexity remains O(n).
